## 👤 About Me

Hi! I'm **Dvir**, a fourth-year Electrical Engineering student at **Ariel University**, majoring in **Computer Engineering** and **Signal Processing**.

I'm passionate about electronics, embedded systems, and digital design. I enjoy building real-time, hardware-integrated projects that combine code with physical components.

### 🔧 What I Work With:

- **Microcontrollers**:  
  Arduino, Raspberry Pi, STM32

- **FPGA Development**:  
  Designing digital systems using VHDL and implementing them on FPGAs

- **Embedded Projects**:  
  Real-time control systems, sensors, communication protocols, automation
